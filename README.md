### Animation Effects
- 360 Rotation: auto rotate the particle visualization in a 360 degree loop
  ![360 Rotation image](assets/documentation/Rotation_Effect.gif)
- Randomized Depth & Circular XY Movement: allow particles to float between closer and farther depths while also travelling in a circular pattern along the XY plane

### Particle Customization
- Color spectrum options (original, grayscale, random)
- Control over particle: size, speed, dispersion, opacity, count (100 - 5000), shape (circle, square, star)

### Particle Link Customization
- Control over particle link: count, opacity, color
